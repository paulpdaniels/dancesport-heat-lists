    <h1>Why post heat lists?</h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            The big competition is coming up! The organizers announce that the heat lists are now posted!
            You go to check it out and what do you find? A link to a small page with your name and a couple of times on it.
            If you are like me you don't just wanna know when your dancing, you want to know against whom.
            That's what this site is built to do. I gather the data and pass the savings on to you!
